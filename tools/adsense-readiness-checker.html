                <article class="content-body" style="max-width: 900px;">
                    <h2 style="border: none; padding-top: 0; margin-top: 0;">What is Google AdSense?</h2>
                    <p>Google AdSense is one of the world's most popular advertising programs for website publishers. Launched by Google in 2003, AdSense allows website owners to display targeted advertisements on their pages and earn revenue when visitors view or click on those ads. The program has helped millions of content creators monetize their websites, from small hobby blogs to major media publications.</p>
                    
                    <p>AdSense works by analyzing your website's content and displaying advertisements that are relevant to your audience. This relevance benefits everyone: advertisers reach their target audience, visitors see ads that might interest them, and publishers earn revenue from ads that perform well. The revenue is typically calculated on a cost-per-click (CPC) or cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM) basis, depending on the ad type.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, not every website is accepted into the AdSense program. Google maintains strict quality guidelines to ensure that advertisements appear on trustworthy, useful websites that provide genuine value to users. <strong>Understanding and meeting these requirements is essential for anyone seeking AdSense approval.</strong></p>

                    <h2>Why Websites Get Rejected by AdSense</h2>
                    <p>Google AdSense has one of the highest rejection rates among advertising programs, and understanding why websites get rejected is crucial for improving your chances of approval. Based on extensive research and community feedback, here are the most common reasons:</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Insufficient or Low-Value Content:</strong> This is by far the most common rejection reason. Google wants to see websites that provide substantial, original content that helps users. Pages with thin content, copied material, or content that exists solely to host ads will be rejected. Most successful applications come from websites with at least 20-30 substantial articles or pages.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Poor Navigation and User Experience:</strong> Websites must be easy to navigate with clear menus, working links, and logical structure. Confusing layouts, broken links, or missing navigation elements signal poor user experience and will result in rejection.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Missing Essential Pages:</strong> Google expects professional websites to include certain pages: Privacy Policy, About page, and Contact information. These pages establish trust and transparency, which are fundamental to AdSense requirements.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> Websites must be technically sound. This includes using HTTPS for security, having proper HTML structure, being mobile-responsive, and loading reasonably fast. Technical problems suggest a website that may not provide a good user experience.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Policy Violations:</strong> Content that violates Google's publisher policies including adult content, copyright infringement, misleading information, or prohibited content will result in immediate rejection.</p>

                    <h2>Why AdSense Readiness Matters</h2>
                    <p>Getting rejected by AdSense is not just an inconvenience; it can set back your monetization timeline significantly. Each rejection requires you to make changes and wait for another review, which can take weeks. Multiple rejections may even affect future applications. <strong>By checking your readiness before applying, you can identify and fix issues upfront</strong>, dramatically improving your chances of first-time approval.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our AdSense Readiness Checker analyzes your website's HTML against the key criteria that reviewers look for. While no tool can guarantee approval (that decision is made by human reviewers at Google), our checker helps you identify obvious issues that would definitely cause rejection, allowing you to fix them before submitting your application.</p>

                    <h2>How This Tool Works</h2>
                    <p>Our AdSense Readiness Checker performs a comprehensive analysis of your website by fetching and examining its HTML content. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the tool works:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>You enter your website URL:</strong> Simply paste your website's address and click the analyze button.</li>
                        <li><strong>The tool fetches your page:</strong> Our tool retrieves your website's HTML content for analysis.</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple checks are performed:</strong> The tool evaluates your page against 10+ criteria including title tags, meta descriptions, content length, and more.</li>
                        <li><strong>Results are calculated:</strong> Each check contributes to your overall readiness score, weighted by importance.</li>
                        <li><strong>You receive actionable feedback:</strong> For each check, you get a status (pass, warning, or fail) along with specific recommendations.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> We use third-party proxy services to fetch your website content. Websites with certain security configurations may not be accessible through our tool.</p>

                    <h2>What Checks Are Performed</h2>
                    <p>Our tool evaluates the following elements of your website:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Title Tag Presence and Length:</strong> Checks if you have a title tag and if it falls within the optimal 50-60 character range.</li>
                        <li><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Verifies you have a meta description and checks its length (optimal: 150-160 characters).</li>
                        <li><strong>H1 Tag Presence:</strong> Ensures your page has a main heading which is essential for content structure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Content Word Count:</strong> Estimates the word count of your visible content to check for thin content issues.</li>
                        <li><strong>Image Alt Attributes:</strong> Checks if images have alt text for accessibility and SEO.</li>
                        <li><strong>HTTPS Security:</strong> Verifies your URL uses secure HTTPS protocol.</li>
                        <li><strong>Navigation Structure:</strong> Looks for proper navigation elements (nav tags, menus).</li>
                        <li><strong>Internal Links:</strong> Checks for the presence of internal links which indicate good site structure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Privacy Policy Link:</strong> Searches for links to privacy policy pages, which are mandatory for AdSense.</li>
                        <li><strong>Footer Presence:</strong> Checks for a footer element which is a sign of professional design.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>What This Tool Does NOT Do</h2>
                    <p>Transparency is a core value at Mr360ai. Here is what our tool cannot do:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It cannot guarantee AdSense approval (no tool can)</li>
                        <li>It cannot access websites behind login walls or with strict security</li>
                        <li>It cannot detect policy violations related to content themes</li>
                        <li>It does not check page speed or server performance</li>
                        <li>It cannot evaluate the quality or originality of your written content</li>
                        <li>It checks only one page at a time, not your entire website</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For a complete assessment, you should use this tool on multiple important pages and complement it with manual review of your content quality.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding Your Readiness Score</h2>
                    <p>After analysis, you will receive a score from 0 to 100:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong style="color: var(--success-green);">80-100 (Green - Ready):</strong> Your page meets most key requirements. Good candidate for application, but remember to apply these checks to all pages.</li>
                        <li><strong style="color: var(--warning-yellow);">50-79 (Yellow - Needs Work):</strong> Some issues need attention before applying. Review the specific recommendations and make improvements.</li>
                        <li><strong style="color: var(--error-red);">0-49 (Red - Not Ready):</strong> Significant issues detected. Address the highlighted problems before considering an AdSense application.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
                    <p><strong>Applying too early:</strong> Many website owners apply for AdSense with brand new sites or sites with only a few pages of content. Google prefers established sites with substantial content.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Ignoring mobile users:</strong> More than half of web traffic comes from mobile devices. If your site is not mobile-friendly, your user experience score will suffer.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Missing policy pages:</strong> Privacy Policy is mandatory for AdSense. Terms of Service and Disclaimer pages also help establish professionalism.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Copying content:</strong> Even with attribution, heavily copied content will get rejected. Focus on creating original, helpful content.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Poor site structure:</strong> Websites should have logical categories, working menus, and easy navigation. Visitors should find what they need within 2-3 clicks.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Broken elements:</strong> Broken links, missing images, and error pages all harm your chances. Audit your site regularly.</p>

                            <p>While technically possible with some platforms like Blogger, it is generally recommended to use a custom domain name (yoursite.com rather than yoursite.blogspot.com). Custom domains appear more professional and have higher approval rates.</p>

                            <p>Low-value content means Google's reviewers determined that your content does not provide sufficient value to users. This could mean thin content (not enough depth), unoriginal content, or content that exists mainly to host ads rather than help readers. Focus on creating comprehensive, helpful articles that thoroughly address user questions.</p>

                            <p>Review times vary significantly. Some applications are reviewed within a few days, while others take 2-4 weeks or longer. During high-volume periods, reviews may take even longer. Patience is important, and you should continue improving your site while waiting.</p>

                            <p>Yes, you can reapply after addressing the issues mentioned in your rejection email. It is recommended to wait at least 2-4 weeks and make substantial improvements before reapplying. Simply reapplying without changes will likely result in another rejection.</p>

                            <p>While not an explicit requirement, HTTPS is strongly recommended and expected for professional websites. Most modern hosting providers offer free SSL certificates. A site without HTTPS appears less trustworthy and may negatively impact your application.</p>

                            <p>Google does not specify a minimum traffic requirement, but having some organic traffic demonstrates that your content is being found and used by real people. Sites with zero traffic may be seen as too new or not yet providing value to users.</p>

                            <p>Yes, affiliate links are allowed alongside AdSense, but they should not dominate your site. Websites that appear to be purely affiliate sites without substantial original content may be rejected. Ensure your affiliate content adds genuine value and is properly disclosed.</p>
