            <h2>No Guarantee of Results</h2>
            <p>Mr360ai does not guarantee any specific results from using our tools or following the advice provided in our content. Specifically:</p>
            
            <p><strong>AdSense Approval:</strong> The use of our AdSense Readiness Checker or following suggestions from our blog articles does not guarantee that your website will be approved for Google AdSense. Approval decisions are made solely by Google's review team based on their own criteria, which may differ from our assessments and may change without notice.</p>
            
            <p><strong>SEO Performance:</strong> Following SEO recommendations from our tools or articles does not guarantee improvements in search engine rankings. Search engine algorithms are complex and change frequently.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Website Performance:</strong> Implementing suggestions from our tools does not guarantee improvements in website traffic, engagement, or revenue.</p>
            
            <p>Success depends on many factors beyond what our tools can assess, including but not limited to: content quality, niche competition, marketing efforts, algorithm changes, and timing.</p>

            <h2>Tool Accuracy Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Our digital tools, including the AdSense Readiness Checker, analyze the information you provide based on predefined criteria. Please understand the following limitations:</p>
            
            <h3>Input Limitations</h3>
            <p>Our tools can only analyze the information you provide. They cannot:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Crawl or access your live website</li>
                <li>Analyze pages beyond what you submit</li>
                <li>Detect issues that require full website access</li>
                <li>Evaluate the quality or originality of your content</li>
                <li>Assess user experience factors like site speed or mobile functionality in real conditions</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Analysis Limitations</h3>
            <p>The analysis performed by our tools:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is based on publicly available guidelines and best practices as of the tool's last update</li>
                <li>May not reflect the most current requirements or criteria used by third parties like Google</li>
                <li>Uses simplified checks that cannot replicate the full complexity of professional audits</li>
                <li>May produce false positives (flagging issues that are not actually problems) or false negatives (missing actual issues)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Score Interpretation</h3>
            <p>Readiness scores and assessments from our tools are relative indicators, not absolute measures. A high score does not guarantee approval or success, and a low score does not mean failure. Scores should be used as one of many data points in your decision-making process.</p>
